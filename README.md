# PKGBUILDs
Contains PKGBUILD files for creating Arch Linux packages of my own and
some other applications.

For some applications it also provides PKGBUILD files for the creation
of Windows binaries with the Mingw-w64 cross compiler.

I also provide a [binary repository](http://martchus.no-ip.biz/repo/arch/ownstuff/os).
